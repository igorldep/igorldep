### Hi there! 👋

My name is Igor Luciano de Paula from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Full-Stack Developer since 2018 and currently I'm Software Developer at [IBM](https://ibm.com).

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

Would you like to find me?
